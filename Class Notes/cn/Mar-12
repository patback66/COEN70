Class, Struct
	Templates
	Constructors(default, non_default, copy)
	Destructor
	operators +,-,*,/,<,>,==,++,--,<<,>>
	public/private/protected

	Inheritance
	Virtual
	Polymorphism
		Destructor must be virtual
Data Structure
	Array (static,dynamic)
		+ Quick Access O(1) if you know the index, search O(n)
		- size change O(n)
	Link-list (Single, Double, Circular)
		+ size change O(1)
		- No Quick Access, Search O(n)
	Tree (Binary, BST, 2 - 3, heap, rb)
		+ Access/Search O(log n)

	ADT (Assume exists)
		Bag (Keyed, Set)
		List (Ordered)
			Iterators
		BST (binary tree)
		AVL (bst)

		2-3 (rb)
			Rotation is easier
			//Implementation easier
			A little bit faster

	BFS
	DFS

	Advantage of ADT
	Disadvantage of ADT

	**Full ADT implementation
		*Consider subclass or wrapper of exist class

	You can say call left rotate
	Call AVL Rotation

	Check completeness
		by default assume all the node is full
		when encounter a node with only left node,
		keep going and check if all the rest nodes are leaf
Induction Prove
	|V| = |E| + 1
	Base Case
		E = 0, V = 1
	Induction
		True for some |E| = k
			|V| = k + 1
		then for |E| = k + 1
			LHS: from statement we get |V| = (k + 1) + 1 = K + 2
			RHS: from k, |V| = k + 1 + 1 = K + 2
